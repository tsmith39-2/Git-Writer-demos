                <ab>Your letter of recent date has been received in the Inking and Painting
                    Department for reply.</ab>
                <ab>Women do not do any of the creative work in connection with preparing the
                    cartoons for the screen, as that work is performed entirely by young men. For
                    this reason girls are not considered for the training school.</ab>
                <ab>The only work open to women consists of tracing the characters on clear
                    celluloid sheets with Indian ink and filling in the tracings on the reverse side
                    with paint according to directions.</ab>
                <ab>In order to apply for a position as “Inker” or “Painter” it is necessary that
                    one appear at the Studio, bringing samples of pen and ink and water color work.
                    It would not be advisable to come to Hollywood with the above specifically in
                    view, as there are really very few openings in comparison with the number of
                    girls who apply.</ab>


                <ab>Yours very truly,</ab>
                <ab>WALT DISNEY PRODUCTIONS, LTD.</ab>
